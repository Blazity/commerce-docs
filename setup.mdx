## CLI

To use the CLI, simply run:

```shell
yarn create commerce

# or

npm create commerce
```

Please note that the CLI simplifies the setup process by allowing you to choose between a full setup, where you enter the required API keys directly and need to have your platforms set up beforehand, or a demo mode, which requires no keys.

## Manual

Whilst we highly recommend using the CLI, you can also set up your project manually by selecting a [starter](/starters) and then obtaining the necessary keys from the respective providers.

**Read more: [Obtaining API Keys](/providers)**

> **Note:** If variables required for the starter are not set, your application will run in **demo mode**.

Below is also the list of environment variables that you'll need to configure for the proper setup no matter which starter you choose.

### 1. Feature Flags

You have two ways to manage feature flags:

- Manually inside Vercel dashboard
- Runtime override using [Vercel Toolbar](https://vercel.com/docs/workflow-collaboration/vercel-toolbar)

The latter allows you to change settings as needed while your application is running. Overrides are not persisted and only effect the user applying them.

- **Variables Required:** `FLAGS_SECRET`
- **Generating your own secret:**
  - `node -e "console.log(crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('base64url'))"`.
  - Copy and add to your `.env.local`

### 2. Live URL

The Live URL is the primary web address where your Enterprise Commerce application is hosted. If you have a custom domain, use that URL. If you don't have a custom domain yet, use the URL provided by your hosting provider. The Live URL is used for generating metadata and can be used for additional functionalities in the future, making it crucial for SEO and the general functioning of the application.

### 3. Providers

Setup for each will vary based on the selected platforms, for more information, [see providers.](/providers)

### 4. Features

Some features are optional and may require additional API keys, you can find them in respective [feature sections](/features).
