## CLI

To use the CLI, simply run:

```shell
yarn create commerce

# or

npm create commerce
```

Please note that the CLI simplifies the setup process by allowing you to choose between a full setup, where you enter the required API keys directly and need to have your platforms set up beforehand, or a demo mode, which requires no keys.


See: [How to setup providers](/providers)

## Manual

To streamline the setup process, we will first list all necessary environment variables required for configuration. Subsequently, we'll provide detailed instructions on [how to obtain each of these variables](/providers).

> **Note:** If below variables are not set, your application will run in **demo mode**. 


```plaintext
SHOPIFY_STORE_DOMAIN=your_store_domain.myshopify.com
SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_storefront_access_token
SHOPIFY_ADMIN_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_admin_access_token
SHOPIFY_APP_API_SECRET_KEY=your_app_api_key
MEILISEARCH_ADMIN_KEY=admin_key
MEILISEARCH_CATEGORIES_INDEX=categories
MEILISEARCH_PRODUCTS_INDEX=products
MEILISEARCH_HOST=https://something.meilisearch.io
LIVE_URL=https://commerce.blazity.com
FLAGS_SECRET=EAMwX-AhlPipEaZfTc-24bxAZ7BvLikwuIV2Zq7FP64 # change to your own
```

### 1. Feature Flags

You have two ways to manage feature flags:

- Manually inside Vercel dashboard
- Runtime override using [Vercel Toolbar](https://vercel.com/docs/workflow-collaboration/vercel-toolbar) 

The latter allows you to change settings as needed while your application is running. Overrides are not persisted and only effect the user applying them.

- **Variables Required:** `FLAGS_SECRET`
- **Generating your own secret:**
    - `node -e "console.log(crypto.randomBytes(32).toString('base64url'))"`.
    - Copy and add to your `.env.local`

### 2. Live URL

The Live URL is the primary web address where your Enterprise Commerce application is hosted. If you have a custom domain, use that URL. If you don't have a custom domain yet, use the URL provided by your hosting provider. The Live URL is used for generating metadata and can be used for additional functionalities in the future, making it crucial for SEO and the general functioning of the application.


### 3. Providers

Setup for each will vary based on the selected platforms, for more information, [see providers.](/providers)


### 4. Features

Different features may require additional API keys, you can find them under [features.](/features)

And that's it! You're all set and can enjoy your fast and swift eCommerce storefront.
