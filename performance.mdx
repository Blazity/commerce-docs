At Blazity, we prioritize speed. Enterprise Commerce is meticulously crafted to deliver top-notch performance for your online store. We achieve this through:

- **Next.js App Router:** This optimizes JavaScript delivery, resulting in faster loading times (improved **Total Blocking Time** and **Time To Interactive**).
- **Static Content and ISR:** We leverage static pages and **Incremental Static Regeneration** (ISR) for lightning-fast loading. Static pages display instantly, unlike dynamic ones that show a white screen initially (impacting **Speed Index**).
- **Small & Feature-Rich Bundles:** We maintain minimal bundle sizes while integrating essential libraries like React Hook Form, Zod, and SWR.

### Real Performance Score

Lighthouse scores offer a valuable comparison tool, but they don't directly translate to SEO or user experience (UX).

For a true picture, prioritize real user data. Tools like CrUX or Vercel Speed Insights provide user-based performance metrics, ensuring your online store delivers a seamless experience for your customers.
