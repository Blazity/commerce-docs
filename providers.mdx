## Search & Merch

### Meilisearch

Meilisearch is a powerful, fast, open-source search engine. 

There are two main ways to host Meilisearch: 

- on-premise (self-hosting on dedicated servers or cloud providers)
- using Meilisearch Cloud.

For the purposes of this guide, we will focus on the recommended approach, which is using Meilisearch Cloud.

**Keys to obtain:**

```
MEILISEARCH_PRODUCTS_INDEX
MEILISEARCH_CATEGORIES_INDEX
MEILISEARCH_ADMIN_KEY
MEILISEARCH_HOST
MEILISEARCH_REVIEWS_INDEX - only if you're using reviews feature
```

To get started with Meilisearch Cloud, navigate to the Meilisearch Cloud platform and [log in](https://cloud.meilisearch.com/).

- Create a new project within the platform.
- Create two indicies called `products` and `categories`. If you wish to use different names make sure your environment variables `MEILISEARCH_PRODUCTS_INDEX` and `MEILISEARCH_CATEGORIES_INDEX` are updated accordingly.
- After your project is set up, proceed to the "Settings" tab of your Meilisearch Cloud project.
- Locate and copy the `Default Admin API Key`. This key should be securely stored in your `.env.local` file under the `MEILISEARCH_ADMIN_KEY` variable.
- Copy the Meilisearch URL and place it in your `.env.local` file under `MEILISEARCH_HOST`. **Ensure you do not include a trailing slash at the end of the URL.**
